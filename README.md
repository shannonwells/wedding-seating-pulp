# wedding-seating-pulp
An annotated Jupyter Notebook solving a wedding seating problem with the PuLP library

Hereâ€™s a notebook for solving a wedding seating problem which I downloaded from the [PuLP library documentation](https://www.coin-or.org/PuLP/CaseStudies/a_set_partitioning_problem.html), which is used to solve the problem.  PuLP is a linear programming library in Python.  To use it, clone this repository. Then:

## Installation and initial use
```
pip install notebook
pip install pulp
cd <this repo>
jupyter notebook

```
From there:
1. Click on "Pulp solving a wedding seating problem.ipynb"
2. Select Cell-->Run all to see the output.
